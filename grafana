What is Grafana ?
Grafana is a popular open-source data visualization and analytics platform that allows you to create custom dashboards and visualizations based on a variety of data sources. Grafana is often used for monitoring and analyzing metrics and logs in real-time, making it an ideal tool for monitoring systems and applications, including Kubernetes environments. Grafana supports a wide range of data sources, including databases, time-series databases, and other data storage systems. It provides a powerful query language that allows you to retrieve and analyze data from these sources, and to create custom dashboards and alerts based on that data. In addition to its powerful data visualization and analysis capabilities, Grafana is also highly extensible. It supports a wide range of plugins and integrations, including integrations with popular monitoring and logging tools like Prometheus, Elasticsearch, and InfluxDB.
